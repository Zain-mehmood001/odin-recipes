# odin-recipes
Welcome to the first HTML project in The Odin project
This project will be about creating a simple website for recipes.
I will have to use all the knowledge I have learned about HTML in this project. This inlcudes adding images, links, file organization and also using git to commit and upload to github.


Good luck! Review after building the website
